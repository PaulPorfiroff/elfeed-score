* Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.5

** Bugfixes

*** Address issue 12

Announce the fact when making a backup copy of the score file. If there is an error on copy, say so & continue (i.e. don't error out).

* Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.4

** User-visible Changes

*** Below changes on the 0.7 branch now available on master
* Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.3

** User-visible Changes

*** Write backup file on score file format version change

If elfeed-score detects that the score file it has read is in a format
prior to the current, it will write a backup file named SCORE-FILE.~N~
where SCORE-FILE is the original score file name and N is the prior
version.
* Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.2

** User-visible Changes

*** Scoring Rules Now Serialized to Property Lists

This build introduces score file format version 6.

elfeed-score will now serialize scoring rules as property lists, rather than flat lists. It will, of course, continue to read all prior versions of the score file format.

Moving to property lists for the rule format, while more prolix, will reduce errors on the part of rule authors & enable better validation & error messages on the part of the package.

*** elfeed-score now requires Emacs 26.1
** Other Changes

Internal changes cleaning-up after the re-factor.
* Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.1

** User-visible Changes

*** elfeed-score documentation re-worked

This build re-works the elfeed-score documentation, breaking
up the README:

  - introductory information & installation instructions remain
    in the README
  - user documentation has been moved to a Texinfo manual
  - developer documentation has been moved to the project Wiki
* Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.0

** User-visible Changes

*** elfeed-score.el re-factored

Heretofore, `elfeed-score' was a single-file package. As the
file has grown to over 2K lines, it became increasingly
difficult to read & reason about. Beginning with the 0.7
series, I've broken it up into several smaller, hopefully
more manageable files.

Numerous functions & variables were renamed to begin with their new package prefix. In the case of public symbols, aliases were introduced so code using the old names will receive a warning about using anobsolete variable or function. However, private symbols were simply renamed-- if you wrote code accessing private symbols, this change will break your code.

modeled on that of `elfeed' itself.

* Changes in elfeed-score 0.3.0

** New Features

*** scoping rules by tag

You can now scope rules by entry tags; rules can be setup to run only on entries that have one or more tags, or that have none of a given set of tags. See the README for syntax details.

*** whole-word matching

Specying a match type of 'w or 'W will perform case-insensitive or case-sensitive (resp.) whole-word regexp matching.

*** title-or-content rules

A new type of scoring rule is introduced: `title-or-content'. Such a rule performs a text match against both the title & content for each entry while allowing two different values to be added to entry's core for each sort of match.

*** Displaying Entry Scores in the Search Buffer

`elfeed-score' now provides an `elfeed-search-print-entry-function' compliant function that will display each entry's score in the first column of the search view. The score format can be controlled by the customization variable `elfeed-score-score-format'.  See the README for instructions.

* Changes in elfeed-score 0.2.0

** New Features

Loading the package no longer affects Elfeed; the package must be enabled via a call to `elfeed-score-enable', and may be unloaded via `elfeed-score-unload' (in accordance with the Emacs Lisp Coding Conventions).
